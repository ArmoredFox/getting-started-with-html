<b>The Basics of HTML</b>

<div>
<br>
<em>HTML</em> stands for Hypertext Markup Language, 
and the internet is basically HTML documents linked<br> together for you to interact with.
It has some basic elements, the <em>text</em>, which is the content you see,<br> 
the <em>markup</em> which is what it looks like, and then <em>links</em> and <em>references</em> to other documents.
<br>
HTML is made of <em>elements</em> and <em>tags</em>, where in you tell the computer what element to 
use<br> by using the proper tag to talk to it.
<br>
<br>
<div><b>Examples of HTML</b></div><br>
<div>Basic commands are executed by using <em>open tags</em> and <em>closed tags</em>. <br>
An <em>open tag</em> may look like <  sample>  and a <em>closed tag</em> like < /sample>.
<br>
Not all commands require a closed tag, some are void tags like < img > or < br >.  
</div>
<br>
<div><b>Inline Vs Block</b></div><br>
<div>There are two kinds of elements, <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b>, and they effect the page differently.
<br> Inline elements exist how they sound, in the line. Block elements create an 'invisible box' around the element.
</div>
<br>
<div><b>Dumb Computers</b></div><br>
One thing   that is most important to rememeber about coding is that computers may be able to do alot<br> of things, but 
thinking is not one of them. Computers are <em>stupid</em>. They read exactly what you have written<br>
and nothing else, if you made a mistake in the code the computer isn't going to fix it, its going to run <br> 
with it and do things you don't want it to.
